# Assignment Week 7: Data Analysis and Visualization with the Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization techniques using the classic Iris dataset. The analysis is performed in Python using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Features
- Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn
- Explores the dataset structure and checks for missing values
- Cleans the dataset if necessary
- Computes basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Groups data by species and analyzes mean values
- Identifies interesting patterns in the data
- Visualizes the data with four different plot types:
  - Line chart
  - Bar chart
  - Histogram
  - Scatter plot
- Customizes plots with titles, axis labels, and legends
- Handles errors gracefully

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

All required packages are listed in your environment. If you need to install them, use:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the script using:
   ```
   C:/Python312/python.exe datapanda.py
   ```
3. The script will display analysis results and show four plots.

## Files
- `datapanda.py`: Main analysis and visualization script
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Notes
- The Iris dataset is loaded directly from scikit-learn, so no external CSV file is needed.
- All plots are displayed interactively; close each plot window to continue.
- The script includes error handling for missing packages and data issues.
